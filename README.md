Crazy Cars

Create a game similar to the Crazy Cars game. Design a road scheme similar to the one in the original game where avatars can move.

Roles:

Two or more players control their avatars using the arrow keys or ASDW keys.
They move up-down-left-right on the road.
Each player has 3 lives per level.
At the start of the level, they are at the bottom of the screen.
Vehicles and obstacles:
Move downwards.
Appear randomly creating a passage for the avatars.
Obstacles are stationary and do not move.
Rules:

The game consists of infinite levels.
If a vehicle touches a player or a player touches an obstacle, they lose a life.
After a certain time, everything moves faster.
The winner is the player who stays in the game the longest.
Upon encountering an obstacle, the avatar loses the ability to move left or right for a short period.
The game ends when all players lose all their lives.
To implement, use Python3, PyQt5, and multiprocessing. Work in teams of 4 members. Write documentation describing the general operation of the application and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of using the Python language, the PyQt5 framework, and parallelization of work.
